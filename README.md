# labor_disputes_pattern

This project plans on scraping Freedom of Association cases from ILO's NORMLEX database (https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:20060:::NO:20060::). I plan on gathering information on the industry affected, type of violation, rulings, actors that reported the violation to the ILO.
